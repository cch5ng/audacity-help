------


Audacity can help with basic noise reduction from a recorded audio file.

1 Open the audio file.

2 Select the section of audio to use as noise sample. For example, a good section might be at the very start of the recording before you start speaking to capture the level of noise.

3 From the **Effect** menu, select **Noise Reduction**.

4 Click the **Get Noise Profile** button.

5 To preview changes

  * Select the section of audio to filter. For example, double-click the timeline to select the entire contents.

  * From the **Effect** menu, select **Noise Reduction**.

  * Click the **Preview** button.

6 Adjust settings as desired and check the preview.

7 Click **OK**.

8 Save the project.
