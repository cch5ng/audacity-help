# Audacity Quick Start Guide

## Purpose

This is a Quick Start guide for using Audacity.


## Use Cases

These are a couple of typical workflows when working with audio:

* Record, play, edit, export

* Play/review, edit, export


## What the guide does not do

This is not a comprehensive guide about professional audio editing and effects. But it is geared to help you get going with practical features for creating and editing audio content.

For example, there are a number of effects and plug-in's which are not described but the Audacity online documentation may help with those.
