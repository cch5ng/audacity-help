# audacity-help

## Purpose

This is a personal project for my technical writing portfolio. It is not intended as a substitute for the Audacity online documentation.

## Credits

This project was compiled with jekyll and styled using the theme, [just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

## Resources

For a list of resources on jekyll, using jekyll themes, creating animated gifs, and creating video tutorials for software, see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/cch5ng/7d110fb20689a1d31bccd033ce45d610).
