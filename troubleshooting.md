# Troubleshooting & Tips

*Note: I love Audacity personally. As an open source tool, I feel like it is really powerful for audio editing. I've used it for personal creative projects and will share my insights.*

## Tips

* Audio editing is a little bit of an art. You might know specifically what you want the resulting file to sound like (for ex, you need a specific time duration) or you might have a general feeling for the result you want. Be willing to spend time to experiment with effects. Edit, review/preview changes, undo changes, and experiment more.

## Troubleshooting

* Generally the most common issue has been missing the required library for exporting to either MP3 or FFmpeg formats. It is possible that you actually downloaded the library but Audacity cannot find the correct path to the library file. You might need to search your hard drive for the file or download the file(s) again and make special note of the installation path.
