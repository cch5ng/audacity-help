# Splitting Audio

**TODO need animated gif**


After trimming the middle of an audio file, you can move one section of audio over to fill in the gap in the middle.

1 Select the end section of the audio. 

2 Click the **Time Shift Tool** button.

3 Click the end section of audio and drag it to the left until it is flush with the ending of the first audio section.

4 Review the audio to check for quality at the point where the 2 sections were joined.

5 Save the project.
